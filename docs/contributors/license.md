                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

## What You Can Do

Under the AGPL v3, you are free to:

- **Use** the software for any purpose, private or commercial.
- **Study** how the software works and modify it.
- **Distribute** original or modified copies, provided you comply with the license terms.
- **Contribute** improvements back to the community.

## Key Requirements

If you distribute a modified version of Stimm, or operate a network service that uses Stimm (e.g., a public voice-assistant service), you must:

1. **Make the source code available** to all users of that service.
2. **Preserve license notices and copyright statements**.
3. **Provide a copy of the AGPL v3 license** with the software.
4. **Disclose any modifications** you have made.

This “network use” clause is the primary difference between AGPL and GPL. It ensures that users of a hosted Stimm instance can access the corresponding source code.

## Trademark Notice

The name **“Stimm”**, the Stimm logo, and related brand assets are **trademarks** of the project maintainers. They are **not** covered by the open-source license.

- You may fork, modify, and distribute the software under the AGPL v3.
- However, if you distribute a derivative product or offer a public service based on this code, you **must remove** the Stimm logo and change the name so as not to suggest an official affiliation or endorsement by Stimm.
